This plugin allows you to select multiple scenes for quick running.

To use it, enable the plugin in Project Settings and open Quick Scenes dock at the bottom. There you can add scenes. You can easily get the scene path by copying it from File System dock. Then you can either run the scene from Quick Scenes dock or mark it as "Use for shortcut" and press F9 to run it.

The addon adds 3 settings to your Project Settings under Addons/Quick Scenes. You can configure the shortcut used for running quick scene (unfortunately due to limitations, you need to copy the scancode from constants in @GlobalScope doc). Do not modify manually other settings.
